Project ideas as stories
========================

# Tsl editor in the web

In order to allow non programmers to quickly write down acceptance criteria, an editor should be provided that allows to write test specifications (similar to markdown) without setup.
In particular no installation of any sort should be necessary (provided that a browser is installed, and some necessary back-end infrastructure is present).

## Envisioned work flow

- Project is created (e.g. via JIRA)
- Project repository is created (e.g. GitHub, Bitbucket)
- User Story is created (e.g. JIRA)
    - is alive only as long as this feature is not implemented yet 
- Test specification is written (closely related to the user story)
    - specification persists even if user story was implemented (and is removed)
    - specification is (only) stored within one repository, either within a test-repo or included into the project repo
    - the project team is responsible to provide a build that allows the tests to run against a consistent setup of the application

## Additional comments

- Changes to a test specification are independent from its creating user story and are synchronized with its repository
- Specifications are kept in exactly one repository
- Specifications are kept within the same repository as all implementing test cases

## Ideas to support this work flow

- UI idea: JIRA has buttons on each user story that allow to list/create test specifications
- The TSL editor will be an Angular app (embedding the TSL editor component)
- This Angular app will communicate with a language backend (servlet) generated by Xtext for the TSL
- The app will communicate with restful HTTP services to provided additional services
- Backend and frontend will be served from docker containers
- The backend will be served by dropwizard
- Each project has its own backend
- Each backend has a persistent volume that allows users to save changes into
- Each user has his/her own workspace into which project/feature branches are (sparsely) checked out
- Save, Commit, Fetch, Pull and Push will be supported actions, whereas the UI for these actions are unknown yet
